User

As a user, I want an application that is easy to use, appeals visually, and easily provides the information I am looking for. I want a display that is similar on desktop and mobile so that my experience is familiar, but has been tailored to maximize ease of use for each viewing experience.

Developer

I want to use industry standards (such as SMACSS) to organize code and styling so that muy code is easy to edit and maintain. I want to have logical placement of code and challenge myself to learn.
